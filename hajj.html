                 <h2>Introdaction</h2>
    <section id="hajj">
        <h3>Hajj</h3>
        	<p>Hajj is an annual Islamic pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia, which is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. It occurs during the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah and is obligatory for all Muslims who are physically and financially able to undertake it at least once in their lifetime. The pilgrimage includes a series of rituals performed over several days, including walking around the Kaaba, standing at Arafat, and throwing stones at pillars representing Satan. Hajj represents spiritual renewal, unity among Muslims, and submission to Allah.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="umrah">
       <h3>Umrah</h3>
       <p>Umrah is a non-mandatory pilgrimage to Mecca that can be performed at any time of the year, unlike Hajj, which has specific dates. It involves a series of rituals, including the Tawaf (circumambulating the Kaaba seven times) and Sa'i (walking seven times between the hills of Safa and Marwah). While Umrah is highly recommended and holds great spiritual significance, it is not one of the Five Pillars of Islam like Hajj. Many Muslims perform Umrah to seek blessings, forgiveness, and spiritual fulfillment.</p>
